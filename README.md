<h1>Swiper.js continuous autoplay smooth slider (Like marquee)</h1>

<h4>Task summary: Set Swiper.js move to work like marquee.</h4>

<h5>Watch Preview:- <a href="https://smooth-marquee-slider.netlify.app/">From Here</a></h5>

<p>The autoplay of Swiper.js stops on each slide when moving. If you rather want to play like marquee and continue moving/sliding, then you just need to edit the CSS and Swiper config. Maybe it will be available in Swipers API in future, but currently (swiper 11.0.6) it is not.</p>
